## Project Overview

The dashboard includes:
- A **sidebar** navigation menu.
- A **progress bar** showing steps for claim submission.
- A **claim form** with input fields, checkboxes, and file upload components.
- A responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

---

## Approach

1. **Modular Components**:  
   - Created reusable components: `Sidebar`, `ProgressBar`, `ClaimForm`, and `UploadField`.
   - Ensured components are clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.

2. **Responsive Design**:  
   - Utilized Tailwind CSS grid system and responsive utilities (`grid-cols`, `flex`, `md`, `sm` breakpoints).

3. **Form Validation**:  
   - Added validation to ensure required fields (e.g., Contract Value) are filled.  
   - Used controlled inputs for interactivity.

4. **Dynamic Elements**:  
   - Checkboxes, dropdowns, and file uploads are functional.

## Challenges

1. **CSS Alignment**: Aligning progress bar steps evenly required careful use of Flexbox.  
   **Solution**: Used Tailwindâ€™s `justify-between` and `w-8 h-8` utilities.

2. **Responsive Testing**: Ensuring consistency across screen sizes was challenging.  
   **Solution**: Used Chrome DevTools for real-time responsiveness testing.

3. **File Upload Handling**: Implementing an interactive upload component that matches the design.  
   **Solution**: Added custom file input styling with Tailwind.

---

## Assumptions

1. The input fields and file upload are placeholders without backend integration.
2. Progress bar only visually reflects the steps; no active navigation between steps was implemented.
3. The placeholder values for "Claim Value" and "Contract Value" were based on the design.
